        <h2>Here's a time line of Alan Turing's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>1912</b> - Born in Maida Vale, London</li>
          <li><b>1934</b> - Graduated at King's College, Cambridge, with a degree in mathematics</li>
          <li><b>1935</b> - At age 22, was elected a Fellow of King's College on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.</li>
          <li><b>1936</b> - Published his "On Computable Numbers" paper, introducing the concept of the Turing Machine and the Turing Test</li>
          <li><b>1938</b> - Obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University</li>
          <li><b>1938</b> - During WW2, Worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence and helped break Germany's Enigma Code.</li>
          <li><b>1945</b> - Worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the first designs for a stored-program computer</li>
          <li><b>1948</b> - Joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers</li>
          <li><b>1952</b> - Wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousovâ€“Zhabotinsky reaction</li>
          <li><b>1952</b> - Prosecuted for homosexual acts (then a crime)</li>
          <li><b>1954</b> - Died by cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning.</li>
        </ul>
